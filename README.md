# Overlook 

## Solo Project

## Overview

Welcome to Overlook! Within this application, a user will be able to login with a given set of credentials. A user will be greeted, be able to see old bookings, upcoming bookings, available rooms on future dates, book rooms, and more. 

## Learning Goals
Use TDD to drive the design of the application
Separate Class-logic code from DOM-related code
Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality
Use object and array prototype methods to perform all tasks required.

## Local Set Up Instructions

- From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- Open terminal by pressing command + space bar, and search for terminal
- Inside of you terminal type `git clone` and then paste the ssh link. It should look like this: [https://github.com/colestephenson1/overlook](https://github.com/colestephenson1/overlook)
- In your terminal type `cd overlook`
- Run `NPM install` from your command line: npm install
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start`
- This will run the Webpack in the terminal so you can view and use the application in your browser
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
- Find the line that says Project is running at: http://localhost:8080/ Copy and paste that URL into your browser into your browser. Now the application set up and ready to use!
- NOTE: Make sure that you type `Control + C` in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.

## Website instruction

- Upon opening the browser, a user may roam the application as they choose.
- A user can view a list of all future bookings on load after login. They can also toggle to past bookings, search by calendar for a date they'd like to book, etc. If a user searches for rooms on a specific day, they can filter those available rooms by room type. Either way, they will also be able to book rooms and see an updated total for all bookings made.


## Technologies Used

- ES6 Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack
- Fetch API
- Mocha
- Chai

## Future Features & Goals
- More imagery associated with the different room types.
- Add an additional feature to search by accomodation package.


## Project management
- As a team, we first began working with logic in each class file and then moved onto working with the DOM in scripts.js
- I used a google document to manage my excalidarws, ideas, and templates for the project: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z36zdjtAyMWkIvBbfZB5UqjWhngIRrtT1vPCAPTFZ5M/edit)
- I used handwritten notes for reminders and guides for next steps after each POM and nightly break.
